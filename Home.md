# LWC v5!

LWC was originally just a chest protection plugin for Minecraft. It is now a multipurpose block protection plugin that can protect many blocks if you allow it to (but by default is normally just chests, furnaces, doors, signs, and trap doors).

LWC v5 is a complete rewrite of the previous version of LWC: v4. This new version of LWC is designed to be the last major version of LWC that will break everything (even though you can convert). LWC works on **Bukkit, Spout, Forge, and Canary**. LWC will work with *Workbench*, the Official Minecraft API once released.

### Currently using LWC v4?

LWC v5 is significantly different than v4 so it is highly recommended that you peruse all links on this page. After you visit these links specific to you (converting & differences) you will want to view the other links to further find out what is new and what has changed or was removed.
